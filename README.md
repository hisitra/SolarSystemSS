# SolarSystemSS
A Solar System Simulator Script for Unity3D Game Engine.

A Script to Generate the Entire Solar System in Unity3D Game Engine.

How this would work-

1. Make a new Unity3D project (3D template).
2. Make an empty GameObject. Now your hierarchy should have only three objects. 
  i. Main Camera, 
  ii. Directional Light, and 
  iii. GameObject (created by you), these three should be on the same level in the hierarchy.
3. Attach the given script to the GameObject.
4. Hit the play button, enjoy.
